##### Task: Create Image Effects Compatible with IE9 and Above

##### Requirements:
* Expand image from center on page load
* Image scale up effect on mouse enter to reveal new image
* Image scale down effect on mouse leave to conceal new image (similar to a blinking eye)

##### Considerations:
* [CSS transitions not supported in IE9](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25581081/does-ie9-support-transition-css3-effects)
* IE Quirks Mode:
  * [jQuery Compatibility](http://jwcooney.com/2011/12/05/internet-explorer-compatibility-mode-breaks-jquery/)
  * [Doctype Declaration](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6529728/html5-doctype-putting-ie9-into-quirks-mode)
